# Command-line Interface

A terminal is for accessing command-line interfaces (CLI) and text user interface (TUI) applications. In this class, we will be using the terminal to build and test C programs. Please get accustomed to the syntax of the command line.

### Open the Terminal app
For macOS users:

In Finder, go to `Applications` -> `Utilities` and open the Terminal app. You can also use the terminal within [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal).

### Useful commands for the Terminal application

Type these into your Terminal Window and hit Enter:

- `pwd` Print Working Directory (prints the path to the directory [folder] that you are currently in)

- `cd` Change Directory (changes working directory to different directory) 
	
	>You can type `cd` and then drag and drop the folder you'd like to work in, into the Terminal Window. This is much faster than typing out the full path

- `ls` Lists the files stored in the Working Directory

- `cp` Makes a copy of a file ("cp file.txt filecopy.txt" makes a copy of file.txt and names it filecopy.txt)

- `mkdir` Makes a new directory (`mkdir NewDirectory` makes a new folder called `NewDirectory`)

- `clear` clears the Terminal Window

- `&&` Means "and also do this", helpful for inputing multiple commands in the same line

- `man` opens the manual for Terminal commands ("man man" will open up the manual for the manual!)

- `~` means home directory

- `nano` is a text editor within Command-line Interface

### Running Python code from Command-line Interface:

- After Python 3 is installed, type and execute `python3` to verify that Python is installed on your machine.
- If Python 3 is installed, our terminal will go in to python specific environment that begins with `>>>`.
- type `exit()` to exit the Python environment.
- Now, type and execute `python3 HelloWorld.py` to run HellowWorld.py.
- You are in the right place if the terminal prints out “Hello, World!” in the display.
